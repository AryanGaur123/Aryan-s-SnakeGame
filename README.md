# Aryan's Snake Game

The idea to create this game started when a couple of classmates and I were competing to get the highest 
score on this game. We played multiple games in the span of an hour, but were bottlnecked by buggy UI's and 
pop up ads. So, I took it upon myself to write the code for a game that had none of those things. 

## Skills Learned

Through this project, I have practiced: 

- Class Design
- Inheritance
- Interface Implementation
- Encapsulation
- Swing Framework
- Event-Driven Programming
- Custom Rendering
- Game Loop
- Collision Detection
- State Management
- Data Structures
- Visual Feedback
- Algorithm implementation
- Edge Case Handling

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys to control the snake's direction
- Eat the red food to grow longer and increase your score
- Avoid hitting the walls or your own tail
- Press SPACE to restart after game over

## How to Run

1. Compile the Java files (Run in terminal):
   
   javac -d bin src/*.java

2. Run the game:
   
   java -cp bin Main


## Game Features

- Controls with arrow keys
- Score tracking
- Game over screen with restart option
